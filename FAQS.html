					<h3>WELCOME TO FAQs</h3>
					<h1>Ye-ha!</h1>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
<p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Obi-Wan is here. <strong> The Force is with him.</strong> <em> Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.</em> You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
<h3>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</h3>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Red Five standing by. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
<ol>
<li>You mean it controls your actions?</li><li>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</li><li>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</li>

<h6>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</h6>

<li>I call it luck.</li><li>I find your lack of faith disturbing.</li><li>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</li>
</ul></li>

<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
<li><p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? What!? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm trying not to, kid. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p></li>
<p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Ye-ha! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p></ol>
