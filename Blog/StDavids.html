				<p>Based in the leafy suburbs of South East London, St Davids is secret favourite of locals for their rich coffee, and doggo hospitality. </p>
				<p>You mean it controls your actions?</p>
				<p>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
				<p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! <strong> It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.</strong> <em> It's such a long way from here.</em> I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
				<p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Red Five standing by. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</li><li>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…</li><li>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</li>
			</ol>

			<h3><b>Bring a fluffy friend, and they get a free meal too!</b></h3>
			
			<p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</li><li>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…</li><li>Red Five standing by.</li>

			<p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>

			<p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Don't underestimate the Force. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
			<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
			<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Ye-ha! The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
			<p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
			<p>As you wish. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
			<p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I find your lack of faith disturbing. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
		<div class="barista">
		<img class="fancybox" src="./Blog_images/barista.jpg" height="220" width="320" title="barista"></div>
			<p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? You don't believe in the Force, do you? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</p>
			<p>What!? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
			<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
			<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
