	<p>Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</p>
<p>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. You don't like your job, you don't strike. <strong> You go in every day and do it really half-assed.</strong> <em> That's the American way.</em> Homer no function beer well without.</p>
<h2>I didn't get rich by signing checks.</h2>
<p>Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2.</p>
<ol>
<li>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?</li><li>But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life.</li><li>Thank you, steal again.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</h3>
<p>I hope I didn't brain my damage. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?</p>
<ul>
<li>Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face!</li><li>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</li><li>Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope I didn't brain my damage. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes! Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"</p>
<p>I didn't get rich by signing checks. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>
<p>Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box… Please do not offer my god a peanut.</p>
<p>Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*</p>
<p>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!</p>
<p>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Human contact: the final frontier. We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.</p>
<p>I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!</p>
<p>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people.</p>
<p>Human contact: the final frontier. A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman.</p>
<p>Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son." Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</p>
