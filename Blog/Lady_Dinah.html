            	   <p>Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium, nestled in a corner of Bethnal Green Road is a cafe at which you are able to enjoy some afternoon tea, and spend some time with their furry residents, a host of cute cats. We went along to see what the hype was about, and we were not disappointed.</p>

                <p>The cafe is a cosy, but open space that smells of winter spices. Once you are welcomed and hang up your belongings, you are led into the dining space which closely resembles a Hogwarts common room, complete with woven carpets.The cats weave between your feet as you order your drinks. 
                You can take a seat alongside the cat trees, and the friendly bunch will entriguingly visit you to say hi. You are welcomed to entertain the cats with the cat-toys supplied by the cafe. And thus your 90 minutes fly by. </p>

                <p>Alongside hosting a clowder of fur-balls, they also offer a variety of delicious food. The extensive tea menu offers all your classics from English breakfast to Peppermint, through to some interesting blends like Caramel Cream, or the house speciality 'Lady Dina's Special Blend'. The fun doesn't stop there! They also brew up a host of speciality drinks for the more adventurous of us.</p>

                <p>They also serve up food if you're feeling peckish, and we recommend the 'Nut Roastie' in this chilly weather to warm you up to your bones. There are also some divine cakes that pair really well with any of the hot drinks, we particularly liked the red velvet. Those will dietary requirements, fear not, the cafe is happy to cater to your needs, and the menu already has many options for gluten-free and vegan diets. </p>

                <p>Entry is Â£10 as of Nov 2017, which gets you entry, a cup of tea, coffee or a soft-drink and a 90-min slot to cuddle some cats. </p>
                <p>Lady Dinah's prides itself on being the 'First Cat Cafe' in London. This cafe gives welcome relief to the hoard of us who love animals, but aren't allowed ot keep them in a city that is increasingly becoming rental-dominant. This cafe also is a welcome relief for many cats who are adopted and rescued off the street by the owners, giving them a warm home, cuddles plentiful and a unique social life for a feline. 
                <p><u>Note:</u> They only allow guests over the age of 12. They don't have anything against kids, it's just as they put it themselves "Kids have a tendency to spook the cats". I totally get this, as the older sister of a cat lover under the age of 8 who loves to show her affection to the cat by yanking their poor tails. </p></p>
                <p>All in all, the cafe is a spot in London that you can't miss. From the ambience to the novelty of being able to have a cat cuddle in the heart of the city, we totally recommend Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium to everyone (over the age of 12 ;).</p>
