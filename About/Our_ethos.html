At Paws Around Town, we believe that animals are a invaluable part of our world. In a city made up increasingly by flats and apartments, we are losing the ability to be around animals. More and more of us are not allowed pets through renting, which we believe is a great shame. This website aims to bring Londoners closer to nature and wildlife, to prove that contrary to the hustle and bustle of a leading international capital, we do and can appreciate wildlife. 

Aim to create a hub for Animal Cafes in London- what does that mean? 
Cafes and eateries that welcome the public to spend some time with animals, offers oft animal bereft Londoners the chance to interact with wildlife and small animals within the contrasting backdrop of the city. There are many benefits to this, which we discuss further on this page, and this is where Paws around Town comes in. We aim to bring collate the cafes and eateries that support, celebrate and welcome animals and animal lovers alike. 

<h2><strong>Cafes and eateries that host Animals</strong></h2> <link to blog tag, or map page since that will have a little bit more content>
Cafes and eateries that look after animals, where you are welcome to come and buy a coffee and piece of cake whilst the animals are free to wander around. We only support cafes and eateries that host fostered animals, that give their profit solely to running the cafe and looking after the animals, and that give back to animal charities.

<h2><strong> Cafes that welcome Animals</strong></h2>
If you’re lucky enough to be a Londoner with a furry friend, then take a look at these spots. They welcome you and your cute companion to take a seat, and while you grab a bite, they can enjoy treats and water or make some new friends. Even if you don’t have a pet, you should check these places out if you want to visit a cafe and spend some time with some charming critters.

<h2><strong>Cafes that offer animal themed food</strong></h2>
These cafes and eateries celebrate animals through their food. Whether the restaurant is draped in foliage and drops you right into the epicentre of the Amazon, or if you are presented with a bento box fashioned with a rice formed panda, if it’s in London, it’ll be here.
